# Config
A collection of configurations files I use to setup the basic environment on a new macOS machine.

## Vim Setup
The majority of my Vim setup comes from this awesome repo:
https://github.com/amix/vimrc

## Theme
My current go-to theme is Panda which can be found here:
https://github.com/PandaTheme

## Steps to setup
